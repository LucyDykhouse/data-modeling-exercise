1. Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database according to a series of guidelines known as normal forms. The primary goals for normalization are to: 1. Eliminate redundancy in the data model, and 2. Ensure that data dependencies are modeled properly, thereby improving the integrity of the data. Together, accomplishing these goals reduces the amount of space that a database requires and secures a logical ordering of the data.

2. As mentioned above, there exists a series of normalization guidelines known as normal forms, which are numbered from the lowest form of normalization, 1, to the highest level of normalization, 5. Practically speaking, the first three levels of normalization, 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF, are used the most frequently, with the other forms being rarely seen. The first normal form, 1NF, specifies the fundamental rules for organizing a database. These rules include organizing the data in rows, making column values the same type, giving a primary key to each row, and removing all repeating groups. A database that is organized according to 2NF has to meet all the requirements of the first normal form along with the requirements of removing data that has a partial dependency on the primary key and moving these data to a new table. Finally, third normal form requires that 2NF is achieved and that no columns have transitive dependencies.
